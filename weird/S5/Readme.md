# Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance

## 54. Conceptual Aside: Classical vs Prototypal Inheritance

ðŸ‘‰ **Inheritance**: One object gets access to the properties and methods of another object.

Simply, you've two objects, _a_ and _b_. _a_ gets the access to the properties and methods of _b_. This is inheritance.

ðŸ‘‰ **Classical Inheritance**: It means the other more popular inheritance types that are in use currently. It's in `C#`, `Java` and in many others to share properties and methods of objects.

It classical which doesn't mean bad or old. It is still great and being used in many large scale applications. However, it also has some downsides. One of the downsides is that it make code way verbose to maintain and know what different variable or method means to work on it.

ðŸ‘‰ **Prototypal Inheritance**: It is another way of share objects. It is also not flawless but it makes code more simple, flexible, extensible and easy to understand.
