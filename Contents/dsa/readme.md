# Data-Structures & Algorithms

Data-structures and algorithms are one of the key tasks to do for a programmer. They build one's thinking abilities and make the foundation strong.

Previously, I solved some problems in [CodeWars](https://codewars.com/users/TutulDevs). I enjoyed solving problems there. After trying and trying when the terminal gets the green border and texts, all the joy I was getting.

However, I couldn't continue then. Now I'm diving again. This time there's no going back.

I made a [roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11If9JEDenTdybPN7scfiu89gYllpQAgcUK7UE3p6Q4Y/edit?usp=sharing) after reading a few blogs. I'm going to follow that.

Platforms I'll use:

- [The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures](https://www.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/)
- [FreeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
